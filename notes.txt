TODO

-- add a selected building field in sessionStorage (will need on homepage and display)
-- add/handle time select button 
    -- show only valid times
    -- update formatDate function so that it just adds 00s if the date doesnt 
        meet character req (right now it cuts off all time)
-- prettify loading screen
-- make a grid of RoomCards rather than the current list
-- display building name 



BUGS
-- when you select a date, it refreshes on the same building,
    but the building doesnt show as selected in the dropdown menu
    -- set the default option selected to the selected building, or nothing if Null
